Shader Compiler Server - Server

Call either glslangValidator or the Microsoft DirectX Shader Compiler through a standard http api. For use on systems where these compilers may not be natively available.

Shader binaries, unlike other binaries, are quite portable. This makes them more suitable to being remotely compiled.
